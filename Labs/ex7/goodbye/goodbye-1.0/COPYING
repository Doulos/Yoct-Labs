This isn't the license file itself. 
This file states under which license the code has been released.

The 'LICENSE = "GPLv2"' variable in the recipe file will automatically choose a GPL v2 license from meta/files/common-licenses

Both this COPYING file together with a generic_GPLv2 will be saved in this package's license deploy directorty:

tmp/deploy/licenses/hello-world/
                    |-- COPYING
                    `-- generic_GPLv2
